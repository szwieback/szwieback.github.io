## Big Geospatial Data

|<img src="http://szwieback.github.io/files/bgd.png" align="left" width="390" > | Analysis of large geospatial data sets and data-driven modeling for solving geoscientific problems. The class intertwines i) cloud-based processing of big vector and raster data sets from GPS surveys, models and remote sensing, and ii) predictive modeling using data science techniques such as Random Forests. |

## Visible and Infrared Remote Sensing

|<a href="http://szwieback.github.io/files/syllabus_659.pdf"><img src="http://szwieback.github.io/files/preview_VIRS.png" align="left" width="390" ></a> | The course covers the principles and practice of remote sensing in the visible and infrared region, including spectral signatures, radiative transfer, image analysis, and information extraction. The laboratory part provides hands-on experience with multispectral, thermal, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data sets. Practical examples are drawn from geology, hydrology, and forestry. |

## Digital Image Processing in the Geosceinces

|<img src="http://szwieback.github.io/files/lakeice.jpg" align="left" width="390" > | Image processing and analysis techniques to monitor and understand the Earth system. Geoscience applications to be addressed include thin-section analysis, remote sensing of geohazards and geomorphometry. Apart from lectures and demonstrations, the advantages and drawbacks of image processing techniques will be evaluated through exercises and a course project. |
